## Course Description

In this course, you will learn how to systematically test your software. More specifically, we are gonna dive into different techniques for you, as a software developer/tester, to derive test cases, based on your specifications and on your source code. You will master different techniques, such as partitioning, structural testing, code coverage, and boundary testing. And even better: we will automate all the tests we create! Yes, we will write (clear and easy to maintain) programs that test our programs! 

## The Curriculum

Topic 1. Automated Software Testing (Weeks 1-2)
We will study the main concepts behind automated software testing. Why do we need automation? Can we test everything? Is there a "silver bullet" technique that we should always apply? What tools should I use?

Topic 2. Functional Testing (Weeks 1-2)
We will start by exploring what kinds of tests we can derive by looking to the specification of the program. Can we partition our software as to only test important paths? Should we think about boundaries? How can we automate these tests?

Topic 3. Structural Testing (Weeks 3-4)
We will explore what kinds of tests we can derive when we have access to the source code of the system. Shall we test all the "ifs"? When should we stop testing? Which code coverage criteria is the best?

Topic 4. Testability and Mock Objects (Weeks 3-4)
In complex software, testing is not enough; we should design our software to be easily testable. We will discuss different architectural/design decisions that will help us testing the software in the future.

Topic 5. Test code smells (Weeks 5)
Automated tests are code. And code have to be maintained. In this module, we'll study the best practices in writing test code.
