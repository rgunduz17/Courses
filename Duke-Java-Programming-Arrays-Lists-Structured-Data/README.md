## Course Description

Build on the software engineering skills you learned in “Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software” by learning new data structures. Use these data structures to build more complex programs that use Java’s object-oriented features. At the end of the course you will write an encryption program and a program to break your encryption algorithm.

## After completing this course you will be able to:

1. Read and write data from/to files;
2. Solve problems involving data files;
3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages); 
4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList;
5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems;
6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

Some code could be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. You can get the IDE from the University website <a href="http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2">here</a>.
