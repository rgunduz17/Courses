# Module Overview

### How to Design Functions

This module is where this course starts to differ from other introductory programming coursesâ€”we are going to start learning the design method, and this should be new material even for people who have programmed before.

### Learning Goals

- Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions that operate on primitive data.
- Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements.
- Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other.
- Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem.

### Planning Your Time

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 4-7 hours of dedicated time to complete.
