# Module Overview

### How to Design Data

In this module we begin learning how to design data representations of problem domain information. While systems tend to have more function designs than data designs, the design of the data turns out to drive the design of the functions. So data design is a critical part of program design.

### Learning Goals

- Be able to use the How to Design Data Definitions (HtDD) recipe to design data definitions for atomic data.
- Be able to identify problem domain information that should be represented as simple atomic data, intervals, enumerations, itemizations and mixed data itemizations.
- Be able to use the Data Driven Templates recipe to generate templates for functions operating on atomic data.
- Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions operating on atomic data.


### Planning Your Time

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 5-8 hours of dedicated time to complete.
