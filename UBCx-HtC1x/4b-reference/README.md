# Module Overview

### Reference

This module's programs are once again much shorter than those from HtDW and Compound.

The videos this module range in length. But there isn't a half hour one! As before, the longer ones are mostly just a step-by-step working through of a problem, so while it takes time to watch, it isn't all new content.

In this module we take a small but very significant step in terms of the complexity of the information we can represent as data. We will start to have designs with more than one data definition each for representing one part of the overall information. As we have seen before this difference will arise in the information, be reflected in the type comments, be carried into the templates by the template rules and show up in the structure of the final function definitions and tests.

### Learning Goal

- Be able to predict and identify the correspondence between references in a data definition and helper function calls in functions that operate on the data.

### Planning Your Time

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 4-6 hours of dedicated time to complete.
