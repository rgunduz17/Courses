## Course Description

This is an intermediate Java course. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science. Our goal is that by the end of this course each and every one of you feels empowered to create a Java program that’s more advanced than any you have created in the past and that is personally interesting to you. In achieving this goal you will also learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, how to leverage the power of existing libraries, how to build graphical user interfaces, and how to use some core algorithms for searching and sorting data. And this course is project-based, so we’ll dive right into the project immediately!

## Done during the course

1. created an interactive graphical map that displayed geospatial data using unfolding maps library and essentials of data cleaning and data visualization
2. used core object oriented programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.
3. implemented event driven programming and implemented effecient searching and sorting techniques for data to be displayed.
