Create an application from scratch with an interesting user interface using what you learned in the User Interface Classes Lesson. For example, here's a screenshot of an app that I created.

This application's user interface is composed of geometric shapes arranged in a particular order. Its layout inspired by the works of Modern Art masters such as Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholson. If you'd like to learn more about this modern art and artists take a look at this website created by our collaborators at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (requires free signup to MoMA's Virtual Gallery for Mobile Cloud Computing with Android).
This application's user interface has one area containing multiple colored rectangles and another containing a SeekBar (sometimes called a Slider). When the user drags the SeekBar, all non-­‐white / non-­‐ grey rectangles gradually change their color. For example, in the previous screenshot the SeekBar is at the leftmost position. In the screenshot below, however, it is in the rightmost position.

This application also contains an Options Menu. When the user clicks on the options menu an option labeled, "More Information" should appear.
When the user clicks on the "More Information" option, a Dialog should appear displaying some text and displaying two Buttons.

If the user clicks on the "Not Now" Button in the Dialog, the Dialog should be dismissed. If the user clicks on the "Visit MOMA" Button, then the Web Browser should be opened to view a web page on the MoMA.org web site. For example, you might link to some object in the MoMA collection that inspired their user interface design, to some cool page on MoMA.org, or simply to the top level web page at www.moma.org.
